# Git-AI: Auto-Generate Git Commit Messages with AI

**Git-AI** is a Python-based CLI tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT models to generate professional and concise Git commit messages based on staged changes. It saves developers time and ensures clear, meaningful commit messages.

---

## Features

- **Analyze Staged Changes**: Automatically reads your staged changes (`git diff --staged`) to understand what has been modified.
- **AI-Generated Commit Messages**: Generates contextually appropriate commit messages using OpenAI's GPT models.
- **Customizable Output**: View the suggested commit message or directly apply it.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git installed and configured
- OpenAI API key

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-ai.git
   cd git-ai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```

## Usage

### Generate a Commit Message
1. Stage your changes in Git:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. Run Git-AI to generate a commit message:
   ```bash
   python git-ai.py
   ```

   Example output:
   ```
   Suggested commit message:
   - Fix null pointer exception in user authentication
   - Update README with installation steps
   ```

3. Use the message manually, or proceed with the following step to commit automatically.

### Automatically Commit
Run Git-AI with the `--commit` flag to generate and apply the commit message:
```bash
python git-ai.py --commit
```

You will be prompted to confirm the commit message before applying it.

## How It Works

1. **Git Integration**:
   - Fetches staged changes using `git diff --staged`.

2. **AI-Powered Suggestions**:
   - Sends the diff summary to OpenAI's GPT model to generate a professional commit message.

3. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - Offers options to preview or directly apply the generated commit message.

## Creating a Binary (macOS)

1. Install **PyInstaller**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Build the executable:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile git-ai.py
   ```

3. The executable will be located in the `dist/` directory. Move it to your system path for global usage:
   ```bash
   mv dist/git-ai /usr/local/bin/git-ai
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/git-ai
   ```

4. Run the tool globally:
   ```bash
   git-ai --commit
   ```

## Examples

### Suggested Commit Message
```bash
python git-ai.py
```

Output:
```
Suggested commit message:
- Update user authentication logic
- Fix typo in error message
```

### Auto-Commit
```bash
python git-ai.py --commit
```

Output:

Do you want to use this commit message? [y/N]: y
Commit successfully applied!
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The script reads the OpenAI API key from the `.env` file or environment variables. Ensure the variable is set:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```
